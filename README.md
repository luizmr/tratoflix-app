## üíª About project (fully responsive)

Personal project built using ReactJS on Front End and for Back end was used JSON Server to build a REST API to store data from videos and categories for Tratoflix. The server was deployed using Heroku, so the deployed application on netlify can access all the data required for get and post methods. So you can add videos and create new categories to improve the user experience if you are a Pawn Stars fan. The video list was built using react slick and the alerts were built using framer motion. Also this application uses custom hooks and react hooks to work with states through the components, to deliver a better experience and a faster app for the user. Enjoy it.
